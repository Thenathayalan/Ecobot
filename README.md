# EcoBot: Autonomous Water Surface Cleaning Robot ðŸŒŠðŸ¤–
**EcoBot** is an innovative, autonomous robot designed to clean water bodies by detecting and removing trash using advanced image processing and real-time navigation technologies. This smart system leverages **YOLO** for trash detection, **ROS2** for navigation, and a robust set of sensors to ensure efficient, precise, and sustainable operation.

# ðŸš€ Project Overview
EcoBot addresses the growing issue of water pollution by providing an **autonomous solution** for cleaning water surfaces. With minimal human intervention, the robot can:

* Detect and classify various types of trash using **real-time image processing**.
* Navigate diverse water bodies autonomously with **GPS** and ultrasonic sensors.
* Collect and store trash efficiently with a high-precision collection mechanism.

EcoBot contributes to **sustainable water management** by cleaning water bodies and providing real-time data for environmental analysis.
